<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Survey</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Draft proposal for techniques for dynamic content</p>
<p class="phone s02"><cite>Joshue:</cite> This goes beyond SCR 21</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> goes through comments in survey with users</p>
<p class="phone s02"><cite>Joshue:</cite> People are using libraies these days... don't now how to address that in our techniques</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> JQUERY is used but we can't rely on it...</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;AWK&gt;</cite> Original comment that kicked this off: <a href="https://www.w3.org/2006/02/lc-comments-tracker/35422/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20140107/2891">https://&zwnj;www.w3.org/&zwnj;2006/&zwnj;02/&zwnj;lc-comments-tracker/&zwnj;35422/&zwnj;WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20140107/&zwnj;2891</a></p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;David_&gt;</cite> Loretta: We shouldn't stand behind a library.. don't endorse anything</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;David_&gt;</cite> test</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMcD: It's a difficult question, I hear what Josh is saying about real world development.</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMcD: We do want to make sure what we put in works.</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMcD: If we did identify widgets that worked well in JQuery for example, what would be the harm? We link to other resources like Juicy Studio etc.</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMcD: We do need to acknowledge if people are doing things right.</p>
<p class="phone s03"><cite>Loretta:</cite> I have nightmare of GOV of Canada or otherw saying, you must you foo library</p>
<p class="phone s04"><cite>David:</cite> Yes it is a real concern</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Original comment was form Wilco... we should address applicability of SCR 21, limit it to that now...</p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> Yes let's limit to SCR 21</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/SCR21">http://&zwnj;www.w3.org/&zwnj;TR/&zwnj;WCAG20-TECHS/&zwnj;SCR21</a></p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> Should we retire it</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Wilco doen't think it aplies to 1.3.1 but it might apply to others such as meaningful sequence</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> it is so braod of a way of using technology, that is cannot be made consise?</p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> </p>
<p class=summary>it could be a simpler techniue to cut down, and perhaps expand out to other applicability</p>
<p class="phone s04"><cite>David:</cite> GOV of Canada called me up and said document.write should not be discouraged</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> seems to discourage some practises rather than encouraging good practises</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> example hard to map to 1.3.1</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> if it was titled how to insert a heading into a oage maybe that work</p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> yes agree, title of technique not accurate</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Loretta&gt;</cite> Someone might check with Cynthia Shelly on the history of this technique.</p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> turning down volume on the don't in the technique could make it a lot more useful</p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>Josh:</cite> can't we map to a conformance requirement</p>
<p class=summary>s/josh/john</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: I don't think we have ever mapped to a conformance requirement</p>
<p class="phone s03"><cite>LORETTA:</cite> We could map to a conformance criteria</p>
<p class="phone s03"><cite>Loretta:</cite> with this mapping to 4.1.1 is that you run risk of things like duplicate ids</p>
<p class=action id=x03><strong>Action:</strong> Josh to ping Cynthia for some background on SCR21</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;trackbot&gt;</cite> Created ACTION-253 - Ping cynthia for some background on scr21 [on Joshue O Connor - due 2014-04-22].</p>
<p class="phone s06"><cite>Gregg:</cite> We try to talk about positives, but you can talk in a positive way about things to avoid... so you could say, &quot;this is done in this way to avoid that.... but we usually try to say why</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;AWK&gt;</cite> Techniques that refer to conformance requirements only currently for CR#1: <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/20140408/#conformance-reqs">http://&zwnj;www.w3.org/&zwnj;WAI/&zwnj;WCAG20/&zwnj;quickref/&zwnj;20140408/#conformance-reqs</a></p>
<p class="phone s06"><cite>Gregg:</cite> wrt to wuestion about mapping to conformance criteria... usually it is in conjunction with a SC, but the things that are required are using SC within the conformance criteria, i think we can refer to them but we try tl map to a SC because the Conformance criteria are on the SCs</p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>JOSH:</cite> +1 on AWK ... rewrite description, new title, relating to example with Form validation would be better</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Loretta&gt;</cite> THe Understanding doc for a conformance criterion with techniques: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-conforming-alt-versions-head">http://&zwnj;www.w3.org/&zwnj;TR/&zwnj;UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/&zwnj;conformance.html#uc-conforming-alt-versions-head</a></p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> wary to map to 4.1.1 but could write failure techniques on messing up dom</p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>JOSH:</cite> scr21 doesn't say why it is wrong to do the things it discourages</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> jamesn, you wanted to ask what is the problem with innerHTML?</p>
<p class=action id=x04><strong>Action:</strong> David to connect with GOV of Canada regarding their objections to the discouraged parts of SCR21</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;trackbot&gt;</cite> 'David' is an ambiguous username. Please try a different identifier, such as family name or username (e.g., dmacdona, dtodd2).</p>
<p class=action id=x05><strong>Action:</strong> dmacdonato connect with GOV of Canada regarding their objections to the discouraged parts of SCR21</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;trackbot&gt;</cite> Error finding 'dmacdonato'. You can review and register nicknames at &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/track/users&gt;.">http://&zwnj;www.w3.org/&zwnj;WAI/&zwnj;GL/&zwnj;track/&zwnj;users&gt;.</a></p>
<p class=action id=x06><strong>Action:</strong> dmacdona : David to connect with GOV of Canada regarding their objections to the discouraged parts of SCR21</p>
<p class="phone s07"><cite>James:</cite> nothing wrong with document.write... it is just old and clunky</p>
<p class="phone s07"><cite>JAMES:</cite> it seems to be a tuotial on scripting... no our role</p>
<p class="phone s07"><cite>JAMES:</cite> some people might look to us</p>
<p class="phone s07"><cite>JAMES:</cite> i don't know where we can assign this</p>
<p class=resolution id=x07><strong>Resolved:</strong> leave open David will get back to us re GOV of Canada</p>

<h3 id=x08>move h87 to a general technique</h3>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Jon_avila&gt;</cite> <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_support/BulletinView.asp?QC=1165">http://&zwnj;www.freedomscientific.com/&zwnj;fs_support/&zwnj;BulletinView.asp?QC=1165</a></p>
<p class="phone s08"><cite>John:</cite> put a tech support... 3rd paragraph explains why it was an issue prior to JAWS 8</p>
<p class=summary>the last few sentence about previous issue... requiring refresh</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: General Techs tend to get ignored.</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: They don't have the same profile. What do we do?</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Yes we should work with EO on that</p>
<p class=resolution id=x09><strong>Resolved:</strong> Accepted as proposed LC 2887</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id=x10>Comment LC-2892: Draft response</h3>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> second option is generally accepted.... We could remove the technique</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: But isn't it important to notify people of changes to the DOM?</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> &lt;gives example&gt;</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;AWK&gt;</cite> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F76.html">http://&zwnj;www.w3.org/&zwnj;TR/&zwnj;WCAG20-TECHS/&zwnj;F76.html</a></p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: This is about changing the users context.</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: But shouldn't it be required? Shouldn't we have a failure where they don't provide instructions for DOM changes?</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: The only thing thats different here is the notion of where the user location is.</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: Where can you put this, where it's not at a location that may be bypassed?</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: What about ARIA?</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: Sure, but that's a different technique.</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: I'd like to think this over.</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> AWK: This isn't about DOM changes, but changes in context.</p>
<p class="phone s08"><cite>JOHN:</cite> would like to have a failure for this DOM... rather have it more general than not at all</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> if success criteria says it do we need a failure</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> my gut is we could leave it ope, or remove it for now, and come back faiure techniques</p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>JOSH:</cite> should remove it</p>
<p class="phone s09"><cite>Jon:</cite> agree part of the title is not great... but if we remove failure we loose the test steps</p>
<p class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> if we remove this are there any failures with test steps</p>
<p class="phone s05"><cite>JOSH:</cite> i don't find test steps useful</p>
<p class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> my preference would be to improve test steps</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: Sounds like we need a larger strategy.</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Joshue&gt;</cite> DMacD: We need to review the way people are doing things now.</p>
<p class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> might be able with describedby to modify... maybe reinstate...</p>
<p class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> would it be the same name or number</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> depends</p>
<p class="phone s09"><cite>JON:</cite> must weigh danger of leaving it with the what we lose if removed</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> Concerned it has a lot of problems</p>
<p class=action id=x11><strong>Action:</strong> David and JON to look at rewriting technique in communication with AWK</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;trackbot&gt;</cite> 'David' is an ambiguous username. Please try a different identifier, such as family name or username (e.g., dmacdona, dtodd2).</p>
<p class="phone s07"><cite>JAMES:</cite> may need mandatory training... should be allowed to replace it</p>
<p class="phone s01"><cite>AWK:</cite> leqve open until May 15, pending action by David and JON, but if we don't we will yank...</p>
<p class=resolution id=x12><strong>Resolved:</strong> dmacdona and JON to work on rewriting technique.... if done before May 15  it will be considered... if not drop it.</p>
<p class=action id=x13><strong>Action:</strong> dmacdona and jon to look at rewriting technique f76 in communication with AWK</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;trackbot&gt;</cite> Created ACTION-254 - And jon to look at rewriting technique f76 in communication with awk [on David MacDonald - due 2014-04-22].</p>

<h3 id=x14>The following is a proposed update to technique H30. The proposal is to add an example 7 to the technique: Example 7REOLUTION:</h3>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;AWK&gt;</cite> JA: this aligns with the HTML spec</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Kathy&gt;</cite> +1</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;AWK&gt;</cite> KW: Works in JAWS</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;AWK&gt;</cite> DMD: reading ok with NVDA</p>
<p class=irc><cite>&lt;Jon_avila&gt;</cite> I have to drop off the call.</p>
